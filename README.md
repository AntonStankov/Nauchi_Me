# Description 
Nauchi_Me Application is web application built by using Spring Framework, PostgreSQL database, and containerized using Docker.
The main focus of the application is to educate students with the best educational method - with online videos linked with their lessons.
If you are interested in sharing your educational video you can put it in my app and wait for response, if it's the best for the exact unit, but if your
video is the best but you didn't write a good summary of the lesson your video and summary(your shared educational unit) will not be able to be seen by the others.


# Technologies 
Used technologies for building this app are Spring Framework(backend), HTML JS (frontend), Docker(container).
For security I am using JWT(Json Web Token) from Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
The used database is PostgreSQL. 
I am still working on the frontend part even it's not finished.
